### A Database generated for Allergens

This projects provides a metadatabase on Allergens and a responsive web interface with several functionalities is added to ease the process of accessing, analyzing or using the data. You can access the data from the CSV and SQL files provided. <br/> <br/>
To understand the interface, the database and the provided functionalities, you may go through this [tutorial](https://maitreyeepaliwal.github.io/Alleropedia-Database-for-Allergens/tutorial.html). <br/> <br/>

The database is displayed in a tabular form. Each entry has a link column entry that directs to the specific page from the source website corresponding to the particular record. The metadatabase of **13,146 entries** consolidates data from 6 feely accessible databases â€“ complete data from 4 allergen dedicated databases and supporting information from the other 2 databases. 
> The 4 databases that served as the major information source are: Comprehensive Protein Allergen Resource (COMPARE), AllergenOnline (FARRP Allergen Database), WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database, and Allergome. <br/> <br/> The other two major databases for extracting information for the three additional columns and filling some of the missing entries are: EPPO Global Database and	CABI Invasive Species Compendium Database. <br/> <br/> Additional information from legitimate sources like NCBI have been added across 13,146 entries. Thereby, making a complete database that provides much more data about the allergens and necessary links have been added to the database in order to help the user navigate across websites to view more detailed information if needed.

## Problem Statement
* Allergic diseases are considered as one of the major health problems worldwide due to their increasing prevalence. 
* Till date, a large number of allergenic proteins have been identified and characterized. 
Several institutions and research groups established databases to collect the available but scattered information. These databases are very informative and contain overlapping data, but address different user groups and list allergens based on varying criteria. 
* Archival and analysis of the large amount of allergy and allergen data denotes a very major challenge in allergen bioinformatics with the advancements in genomic, proteomic, and analytical techniques. 

In the wake of the ever-expanding volume of the data on allergens, it becomes vital to focus on the developing of databases/resources that will integrate information from different sources as well as from literature and provide an easy efficient access to it.

<br/>

## Proposed Idea 
Considering the strengths and weaknesses of some widely used, freely accessible databases of allergens, we have worked on to:
1. Generate a common database combining 4 such databases, 
1. Add our contribution to the data and 
1. Develop a user friendly interface with some added features
1. Provide a tutorial for the better understanding to use the database and its features.
<br/>

## Novely
*	There is no existing database or metadetabase of Allergens that provides such a comprehensive database of allergen related information. 
*	Additional features and functionalities have been added to make it easy to read, access, analyse and further use the data.
*	The three columns:  Authority, Habitat and Organism Type are not present in any of the 4 databases.  
<br/>

Since, Github pages only hosts static page, the link for database is not operational. Hence, to obtain the database and the interface as explained in the [tutorial](https://maitreyeepaliwal.github.io/Alleropedia-Database-for-Allergens/tutorial.html), you need to download the repo documents, import the csv/sql files in phpmyadmin and run this on the local host.
I am attaching database screenshots of the database tab for your consideration.
